# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-11-04

### Fixed
- A game no longer crashes when an outdated plugin is installed alongside:
  shared modules left behind by an older plugin are replaced by this
  plugin's own copy instead of being used as they are.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-11-04

### Changed
- Uses less memory: the game loads when you open it, not when KOReader
  starts, so it no longer takes memory or startup time while unplayed.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-04

### Changed
- Opening the game no longer builds a puzzle it then throws away (it was
  generated even when a saved game was about to be restored).

## [1.3.3] - 2026-11-03

### Changed
- Picks up game-common 1.11.0: the shared on-screen keyboard (where used)
  gives every key the same letter size, and the no-repeat history helper.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-11-02

### Changed
- Picks up game-common 1.10.0: the shared Tools → Games menu also lists
  the games' new "· multiplayer" entries under Party & quiz.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-11-02

### Changed
- Listed under **Tools → Games**, grouped by category, instead of its own
  entry in the Tools menu (game-common 1.9.1).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-10-30

### Changed
- Redesigned play screen: the grid and its clues fill the room the controls
  leave, with a full-width Undo/Check/Hint/Reveal bar.
- The status line reads "8×8 · Medium · Ships: 5/20" and wraps in landscape.
  The "Tap=cycle Hold=water" gesture help moved to the rules, which now
  describe the cycle correctly (ship, water, empty).
- Title-bar menu: "Size: 8×8" and "Difficulty: Medium" instead of the bare
  values.
- Once the fleet is found (or revealed), the action bar shows "New game" in
  place of its buttons.

### Fixed
- Clue numbers overflowed their band on high-DPI screens (their size was
  scaled by DPI twice); they are now fitted to it.
- The grid was drawn one clue row too low, leaving an empty band above it and
  pushing the column clues past the bottom of the board.
- An applied Hint no longer wipes the saved game (game-common saved it as
  nil). When a hint fills the last cell, the status now shows the win message.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- The Tools menu entry is translated again. `main.lua` took `_` from
  KOReader's `gettext`, which knows nothing of this plugin's strings, so the
  menu label stayed English while the game's own screen, which goes through
  `i18n`, was translated. `_` now comes from `i18n` here too.


## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Picks up game-common v1.5.0. Play statistics were recorded under a key no
  tool could match: `ReaderUI`/`FileManager:registerModule()` rewrite a plugin
  instance's `name` to `reader<id>` / `filemanager<id>` right after it is
  built, so this game's sessions were split across two rows and neither
  carried its plugin id. Rows written under the old keys are merged back on
  first read. The same release brings the `stopPlugin()` /
  `deletePluginSettings()` hooks KOReader 2026.07 calls when a plugin is
  deleted from the device (PR #15240).

  No change to this plugin's own code -- it inherits all of it from the
  shared library.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Hint** button. Two taps, not one: the first says which cell is about to
  give, the second acts on it -- a player who is told where to look usually
  finds the rest themselves, and only pays for the full reveal if they want
  it. A cell that contradicts the solution is always reported before a fresh
  one is revealed, and on a mistake the hint empties the cell rather than
  solving it.
